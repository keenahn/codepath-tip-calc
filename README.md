# TipCalculator

This is a Tip Calculator application for iOS submitted as the [pre-assignment](https://gist.github.com/timothy1ee/7747214) requirement for CodePath.

Time spent: ~5-6 hours


Completed:

* [x] Required: User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Required: Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] Optional: UI animations


*
  [] Optional: Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder.

  * I chose not to implement this one because the interface look cluttered.
